## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) may be the most epic computer science event of the year not named [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com).

Because I'm still weak with more sophisticated logic, I primarily stick with the languages I know well (in this case, Erlang) although I may experiment with [LFE](http://lfe.io) this year if time permits.

Typically each day can be run by invoking `day<n>:part1("input.txt")` and `day<n>:part2("input.txt")`, although occasionally the inputs may not be in a file, and sometimes if I'm in a hurry I'll break the logic behind part 1 while extending it for part 2.

Files named "sample.txt" typically are examples from the problem specification used to test my logic.

I'll carry `myio.erl` along each day so that I can tweak its logic without breaking previous days' efforts. Frankly, though, it's gotten so long that I've forgotten how to use most of its functions; I'll probably write a test suite for it eventually so I have example code.
